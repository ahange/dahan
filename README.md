  Built and deploy internal tools.
</p>


ToolJet is an **open-source low-code framework** to build and deploy internal tools quickly without much effort from the engineering teams. You can connect to your data sources such as databases ( like PostgreSQL, Redis, etc ), API endpoints ( ToolJet supports importing OpenAPI spec & OAuth2 authorization) and external services ( like Stripe, Google Sheets ) and use our pre-built UI widgets to build internal tools.

## Features

- Visual app builder with widgets such as tables, buttons, dropdowns and more
- Connect to databases, APIs and external services
- Deploy on-premise
- Granular access control on organization level and app level
- Write JS code almost anywhere in the builder
- Query editors for all supported data sources
- Transform query results using JS code 
- Import endpoints from OpenAPI specs 
- Support for OAuth

## Quickstart
