# Debugger    

Debugger is on the left-sidebar of the app builder. The debugger captures errors in queries. For example, when a database query fails due to the unavailability of a database or when a REST API query fails due to an incorrect URL, the errors will be displayed on the debugger. The debugger also displays relevant data related to the error along with the error message.

## Pin Debugger
Pinning the popover can be helpful while debugging the queries. The debugger will remain open until it is unpinned.
