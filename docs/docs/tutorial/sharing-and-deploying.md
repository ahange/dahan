# Sharing and deploying apps

Now let's see how we can share the app that we built in the previous steps with other users of your organizations. 

Click on the share button on top right corner of the app builder to add new app users.

If you want the application to be publicly accessed without authentications, make the application public using the same prompt. 

:::tip
Unauthenticated users will not have edit access to the public apps.
